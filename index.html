                <h2>Introduction to the Big Bang</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The Big Bang is the idea that the universe was suddenly born and is not infinite.</li><br>
                  <li>Up to the middle of the 20th century, most scientists thought of the universe as inifinite and ageless.</li><br>
                  <li>Until Einstein's theory of relativity gave us a better understanring of gravity, and Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies are moving apart from one another in a way that fits previous predictions.</li><br>
                  <li>In 1964, by accident, cosmic background radiation was discovered, a relic of the early universe, which together with other observational evidence, made the Big Bang the accepted theory in science.</li><br>
                  <li>Since then, improved technology like the Hubble telescope has given us a pretty good picture of the Big Bang and the structure of the cosmos.</li>

                  <h2>History of the Universe</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The Big Bang was not an explosion, but rather space stretching everywhere all at once.</li><br>
                    <li>The universe started very small and quickly expanded to the size of a football field.</li><br>
                    <li>Space was just expanding into itself; there is no outside the universe.</li><br>
                    <li>The universe is all there is; there are no borders.</li><br>
                    <li>Energy turned into particles for a very brief time.</li><br>
                    <li>Quarks and gluons were created and interacted to form matter and energy.</li><br>
                    <li>Matter won over antimatter, which is why we have almost all matter and very little antimatter today.</li><br>
                    <li>The universe has several refined forces acting under different rules.</li><br>
                    <li>The universe has stretched to a billion kilometers in diameter, which has led to a decrease in temperature.</li><br>
                    <li>The cycle of quarks being born and converted back to energy suddenly stopped.</li>

                  <h2>Questions to Ask Ourselves</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Many questions remain unanswered about the Big Bang.</li><br>
                    <li>Scientists are still trying to understand what happened at the beginning of the universe, which is the Big Bang.</li><br>
                    <li>We do not know what happened, and natural laws stop making sense.</li><br>
                    <li>To understand this, we need a theory that unifies Einstein's relativity and quantum mechanics.</li><br>
                    <li>Scientists are working on this theory, but it leaves us with unanswered questions.</li><br>
                    <li>For instance, were there universes before our own, or is this the first and only universe?</li><br>
                    <li>What caused the Big Bang, or did it occur naturally based on laws that we do not understand yet?</li><br>
                    <li>Despite the unanswered questions, we know that the universe started with the Big Bang and gave birth to particles, galaxies, stars, the Earth, and humans.</li><br>
                    <li>We are part of the universe, and we are the universe's way of experiencing itself.</li><br>

                    <li>George Gamow, who first proposed the idea of the Big Bang in the 1940s.</li><br>
                    <li>Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity was also important in the development of the Big Bang theory.</li><br>
