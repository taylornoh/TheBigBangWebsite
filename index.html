                  <li>The Big Bang Theory is the leading explanation for how the universe began.</li><br> 
                  <li>The universe as we know it started with an infinitely hot and dense single point.</li><br>
                  <li>The single point inflated and stretched over the next 13.7 billion years.</li><br>
                  <li>The inflation and stretching occurred first at unimaginable speeds and then at a more measurable rate.</li><br>
                  <li>The universe is still expanding today.</li>

                  <h2>History of the Universe</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The Big Bang was not an explosion, but instead, all space stretched simultaneously.</li><br>
                    <li>The universe started very small and expanded quickly to the size of a football, but it did not expand into anything.</li><br>
                    <li>The universe has no borders; therefore, there is no "outside" of it.</li><br>
                    <li>Energy manifested itself into particles that existed for an extremely short amount of time, including gluons and pairs of quarks, which destroyed each other.</li><br>
                    <li>Matter and energy were so hot that they were practically the same stuff.</li><br>
                    <li>Eventually, matter won over antimatter, leaving us with almost all matter and very little antimatter.</li><br>
                    <li>The universe continued to stretch, and quarks began forming new particles, such as protons and neutrons.</li><br>
                    <li>Eventually, the universe grew to one hundred billion kilometers and was cold enough for neutrons to decay into protons, forming the first atom, hydrogen.</li><br>
                    <li>Over millions of years, hydrogen gas clumped together, and stars and galaxies began to form, allowing visible light to pass.</li>

                  <h2>Evidence for the Big Bang</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The Big Bang theory posits that the universe was not infinite but had a sudden beginning.</li><br>
                    <li>Most scientists believed until the middle of the 20th century that the universe was ageless and infinite.</li><br>
                    <li>Edwin Hubble's discovery of galaxies moving away from each other and Einstein's theory of relativity led to a better understanding of gravity.</li><br>
                    <li>In 1964, the discovery of cosmic background radiation, a relic of the early universe, and other observational evidence made the Big Bang the accepted theory in science.</li><br>
                    <li>Technology like the Hubble telescope has helped us understand the Big Bang and the structure of the cosmos.</li><br>
                    <li>Recent observations suggest that the expansion of the universe is accelerating.</li><br>

                  <h2>Theories of the Big Bang</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Many questions remain unanswered about the Big Bang.</li><br>
                    <li>Scientists are still trying to understand what happened at the beginning of the universe, which is the Big Bang.</li><br>
                    <li>We do not know what happened, and natural laws stop making sense.</li><br>
                    <li>To understand this, we need a theory that unifies Einstein's relativity and quantum mechanics.</li><br>
                    <li>Scientists are working on this theory, but it leaves us with unanswered questions.</li><br>
                    <li>For instance, were there universes before our own, or is this the first and only universe?</li><br>
                    <li>What caused the Big Bang, or did it occur naturally based on laws that we do not understand yet?</li><br>
                    <li>Despite the unanswered questions, we know that the universe started with the Big Bang and gave birth to particles, galaxies, stars, the Earth, and humans.</li><br>
                    <li>We are part of the universe, and we are the universe's way of experiencing itself.</li><br>
                    <li>Let's keep exploring and experiencing the universe until there are no more questions left to ask.</li>
